This project was created for the [Admin Dashboard assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/admin-dashboard) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.
